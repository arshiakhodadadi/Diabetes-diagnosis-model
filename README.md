# Diabetes-diagnosis-model
The diabetes prediction model is developed using medical data and machine learning algorithms. It analyzes features like age, BMI, and glucose level to predict the likelihood of diabetes. High accuracy and simple implementation are key features of this project.

About Dataset
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the way the body processes blood sugar, also known as glucose. Glucose is an important source of energy for the body's cells, and insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps to regulate glucose levels in the blood.

In people with diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin, or it can't effectively use the insulin it produces. This causes glucose to build up in the blood, leading to a range of health problems over time.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. It occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections or use an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar levels.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for around 90% of all cases. It usually develops in adults, but can also occur in children and teenagers. In type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin, and the pancreas may not produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels in check. Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can help manage type 2 diabetes, and some people may also need medication or insulin therapy.

Both types of diabetes can lead to serious health complications over time, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye problems. It's important for people with diabetes to work closely with their healthcare team to manage their condition and prevent these complications.
